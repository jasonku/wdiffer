## About wdiffer

wdiffer is a simple web tool to compare (["diff"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff_utility), in computer slang) words in two chunks of text. It's named after (and functionally almost equivalent to) the GNU tool [wdiff](http://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/) but is implemented on top of [jsdiff](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff).

## History

The use case I had in mind when I built this little page is [Bible memorization](http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/ten-reasons-to-memorize-big-chunks-of-the-bible). My fianc√©e and I had been memorizing the book of [Colossians](http://esv.literalword.com/?q=col+1-4) together, testing each other on our progress every week. In December 2014, she went traveling with her family and was hard to contact, and I wanted a way to test myself more accurately while we weren't able to test each other.

There are other similar tools out there but I found them to be cluttery, hard to read, hard to use, or lacking features.

## TODOs

* Show original input casing when ignoring case.
* Support ignoring of punctuation.
* Equate smart quotes with normal quotes.
* Randomize the verses that show up as placeholders in the textarea inputs.
